How to use the model:
1.	To use the model, you need to get a webcam (or a phone with a camera) and face-tracking software (I do recommend VTube Studio, I have set up everything in VTube Studio):
		VTube Studio = https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/
		PrprLive = https://store.steampowered.com/app/1279610/PrprLive/
		Animaze = https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364390/Animaze_by_FaceRig/
		VUP = https://store.steampowered.com/app/1207050/VUP_VTuber__Animation__motion_capture__3D__Live2D/
2.	Unzip the downloaded folder, and put the folder into in directory of the face-tracking software, for VTube Studio it is in: <Your Steam Installation Directory>\Steamapps\Common\VTube Studio\VTube Studio_Data\StreamingAssets\Live2DModels
3.	Start the face-tracking software and play with it!
4.	But sure to calibrate and fine-tune the face-tracking software to get the best result!

Different expressions can be toggled on/off by hotkeys:
Numpad 1 = angry
Numpad 2 = frenzy
Numpad 3 = sad
Numpad 0 = clear all the expressions

***Please do clear all the expressions using Numpad 0 before changing to another expression to prevent stacking which will not look good on the model.***


Full custom animations can be triggered by hotkeys:
F1 = hair cut
F2 = fling scissors
F3 = fling scissor short
F4 = hello/greeting
F5 = under the skirt


Extra/simple expressions can be toggled on/off by hotkeys:
Numpad 4 = sans eye glow
Numpad 5 = dark mask
Numpad 6 = dark mask2
Numpad 7 = tongue out (works on frenzy expression only, it is also trackable) 
F8 = dark mask3
F9 = dark mask4
F10 = shy
F11 = tear

**All the expressions can be clear using Numpad 0***


Extra custom animations can be triggered by hotkeys:
N1 = angry
N2 = frenzy
N3 = sad

***The animations are triggered by the non-Numpad number key, it is the same as the previous expressions but with extra body and head movement***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Idle/looping animation can be toggled on/off by hotkey (For some weird reason, this only works after turning ON and OFF the camera at least once):
Numpad 8 = hand fiddle idle
Numpad 9 = shy/blush idle
Numpad 0 = breathing/clear all the idle animation

***Idle animation will loop indefinitely until it gets cancelled or changed. It will be overwritten by tracking or other animations.***


Reverse body movement can be toggled on/off by hotkey:
N7 = reverse body X (turning left/right) movement
N8 = reverse body Y (turning up/down) movement
N9 = reverse body Z (tilting left/right) movement

***Normally, when the head turns to the right, the body will turn to the right, and the body will follow the direction of the head movement.
If the body movement is reversed, when the head turns to the right, the body will turn to the left instead, the opposite direction of head movement.***


Walking/Jumping animation:
Q = walking
W = running
Spacebar = jumping

***Hit Numpad 0 to stop the walking/running animation***
